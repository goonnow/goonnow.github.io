I am a PhD candidate at [Max Planck School of Cognition][mps-cog]. At the intersection of computer and cognitive science,
I attempt to investigate how we can verify and explain deep learning models. Therefore, my research interests includes:

- Deep Learning and its interpretability
- Knowledge acquisition and language representation in the brain
- Natural language processing
- Data visualization and journalism
- Civic technology


Previously, I completed a dual master's degree from [Eindhoven University of Technology][tue] and [Technical University of Berlin][tub], under [EIT Digital Master School][eit].
My master's thesis Designing RNNs for Explainability was supervised by [Prof. Dr. Klaus-Robert Müller][profmuller] and [Dr. Grégoire Montavon][gregoire].
