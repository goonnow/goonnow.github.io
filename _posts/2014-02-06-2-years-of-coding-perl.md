I started myself coding Perl at [ABCTech-Thailand][1] in 2012. It’s my first full-time job. In that time, I was mainly using C# and PHP for my senior project. So after I started, everything in Perl was very obscure, no structure, a lot of coding pattern and hard to debug if you don’t have a trick. For me, It was a huge changed because C# is so tidy and exact pattern. One thing that I took a lot of effort to learn is **CPAN network**. It’s very challenging for me to find and understand module’s document.  Every time I found the way to use the module by myself, I felt very very proud.

After 4 months later, I found a trick that make me understand more clearly how to use submodule inside them, what kind of parameter they require. The solution is reading inside **/t** that the author provide for us. If you’re still confused, walking through its code might help you at least. Another thing that I’ve learnt along coding Perl is **TDD** method. I think, It’s an important method that programmer should know at least. I’ve been written test as much as I can. Writing unit-test always challenges me. It’s charm of covering all of your code  with the test. Everything seems to be easy when the tests are in place. You can do refactor anytime you want and do debug easily when something broke. In conclusion, It’s a good opportunity that I’ve known Perl and TDD since I started the job. Coding in Perl gave me many important technic that new programmer should know.  If you’re junior programmer, I deeply convince you to try it. You’ll have some fun. ;)
