Watching a football game is my favourite activity during weekend, and I always think of how football organises  calculate players rating after match. That question is always in my mind since I was young. So, last week, I decided to create my own player rating formula in order to use on my weekly match with my colleague. 

There is only 2 inputs for the formula, which is amount of goal and who make it.  The overall rating comes the summation between team rating and personal abilities, which weighting differently. At the moment, I give 80% of the rating coming from team and the rest from ability.

- **PS** : Player's score
- **TMS** : Team's score
- **TS** : Total score

It's such a interesting formula. Another inputs might be added later as well as using rating to do something else, such as separating team more balance or predict match's result.

have fun :)
