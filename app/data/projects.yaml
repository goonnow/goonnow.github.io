    title: Black Box Optimization using RNNs
    date: 2017
    desc: We extend on the work of Chen et al., who introduce a new, learning-based, approach to global Black-Box optimization. They train a LSTM model, on functions sampled from a Gaussian process, to output an optimal sequence of sample points, i.e. a sequence of points that minimize those training functions. We verify the claims made by the authors, confirming that such a trained model is able to generalize to a wide variety of synthetic Black-Box functions, as well as to the real world problems of airfoil optimization and hyperparameter tuning of a SVM classifier. We show that the method performs comparably to state-of-the-art Black-Box optimization algorithms on these benchmarks, while outperforming them by a wide margin w.r.t. computation time. We thoroughly investigate the effects of different loss functions and training distributions on the methods performance and examine ways to improve it in the presence of prior knowledge.

    title: Code Generation for Apache Flink's NormalizedKeySorter
    date: 2016-2017
    desc: The current implementation of NormalizedKeySorter is generic for all data types which is less efficient comparing to type-specific ones. The goal of this project aims to create custom implementation for each underlying data, thus overall performance improved.

    title: Mining IRS990 Data
    date: 2017
    desc: This project aims to compute statistics for IRS990 dataset, which are financial report from non-profit organizations. The dataset is stored in individual XML file for each organization that makes the mining non-trivial. I uses AWS's Lambda and MapReduce paradigm to tackle this problem.

    title: Who find the Netherlands a new home(hope)?
    date: 2016
    desc: A vizualization of asylum requests to the Netherlands. My partner and I incorporated vizualization priciples into the design that balances between aesthetic and usability. Most of the important components here are implemented from scratch using d3.
