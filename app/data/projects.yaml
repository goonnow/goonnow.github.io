    title:  Visually Similar Image Search (in progress)
    date: 2019
    desc: 
        > 
        Finding similar images can be useful in many cases. For example, one can use it to retrieve mountain photos
        from a ton of photos in his/her gallery. Our first experiment achieves this search by using a nearest neighbour approach
        over features produced by pretrained neural networks. Currently, we are testing with techniques such as
        Autoencoders, Siamese networks, and TripetLoss.

        If you happen to use Spotify and play a music instrustument like me, you might sometimes want to
        repeatedly play certain pieces of songs on Spotify for practicing. Loopify is the answer for that!

    title: Designing RNNs for Explainability (M.Sc. Thesis)
    date: 2018
    desc:
        > 
        We study how the architecture of RNNs influences the level of explainability. We use existing
        explaination methods, such as LRP, Deep Taylor Decomposition, and Guided Backprop, to explain prediction from RNNs.
        Our experiments show that RNN architectures can have significantly different levels of explainability although they perform
        equally well in terms of an objective function.

    title: Monte Carlo Particle Filter for Localization
    date: 2018
    desc: 
        >
        Particle filter algorithm is a nonparametric approach using a set of particles to approximate
        the posterior distribution of some random processes. In this project, we develop a robot
        simulator and implement the algorithm to localize the location of a robot in mazes.

    title: LaTeX âš¡ Sketch Plugin
    date: 2017
    desc: 
        > 
        The plugin brings LaTeX's functionalities to Sketch, a popular vector-based design application.
        It allows us to create nice mathematical formulas directly inside Sketch. For example, I used it to design
        figures for my master's thesis and its poster.

    title: Black Box Optimization using RNNs
    date: 2017
    desc: 
        > 
        We extend on the work of Chen et al. (2016), who introduce a new learning-based approach to global Black-Box optimization.
        They train a LSTM model on functions sampled from Gaussian processes, learning to find an point that 
        those training functions. We verified the claims made by the authors and conducted further experiments using various loss functions.
        We also applied these learned LSTM models to airfoil optimization and hyperparameter tuning of a SVM classifier. 
        Our experiments show that the learning approach can produces optimizers that perform comparably to state-of-the-art Black-Box optimization algorithms on these benchmarks

    title: Code Generation for Apache Flink's NormalizedKeySorter
    date: 2016-2017
    desc:
        >
        The current implementation of NormalizedKeySorter is a generic implementation for all data types. Although this implementation
        has an advantage of code maintenance, it creates unneccesary CPU branches for certain data types, causing needless latency. We solve
        this problem by online creating a customer sorter for each data type. Our experiments show that this code-generated approach
        reduces running time significantly.

#        The current implementation of NormalizedKeySorter is generic for all data types which is less
#        efficient comparing to type-specific ones. The goal of this project aims to create custom
#        implementation for each underlying data, thus overall performance improved.

    title: Mining IRS990 Data with AWS Lambda
    date: 2017
    desc:
        > 
        This project is a proof-of-concept showing how to use Amazon AWS's Lamba as a massive-scale data pipeline. 
        For the IRS990 dataset, this approach can reduces the processing time down to to 25 minutes, significantly faster than
        using other approaches, such as Apache Spark, directly.
# aims to compute statistics for IRS990 dataset, which are financial report from non-profit organizations.
# The dataset is stored in individual XML file for each organization that makes the mining non-trivial.
# I uses AWS's Lambda and MapReduce paradigm to tackle this problem.
