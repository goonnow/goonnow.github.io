    title: Black Box Optimization using RNNs
    date: 2017
    desc: We extend on the work of Chen et al., who introduce a new, learning-based, approach to global Black-Box optimization. They train a LSTM model, on functions sampled from a Gaussian process, to output an optimal sequence of sample points, i.e. a sequence of points that minimize those training functions. We verify the claims made by the authors, confirming that such a trained model is able to generalize to a wide variety of synthetic Black-Box functions, as well as to the real world problems of airfoil optimization and hyperparameter tuning of a SVM classifier. We show that the method performs comparably to state-of-the-art Black-Box optimization algorithms on these benchmarks, while outperforming them by a wide margin w.r.t. computation time. We thoroughly investigate the effects of different loss functions and training distributions on the methods performance and examine ways to improve it in the presence of prior knowledge.

    title: MacOS Spotify Song Looper
    date: 2017
    desc: This script provides an ability to loop a part of a song played on MacOS Spotify client. This is handy for practicing a riff. It leverages Spotify's AppleScript API.

    title: Code Generation for Apache Flink's NormalizedKeySorter
    date: 2017
    desc: The current implementation of NormalizedKeySorter is generic for all data types which is less efficient comparing to type-specific ones. The goal of this project aims to create custom implementation for each underlying data, thus overall performance improved.
